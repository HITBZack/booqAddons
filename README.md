## 📦 Installation

> Requirements:
- Node.js (or your relevant backend if applicable)
- Access to Booqable API
- (Optional) WordPress + booqwp plugin

1. Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/HITBZack/booqAddons.git
Configure your .env or config.js with your Booqable API key and settings.

Run the app:

bash
Copy
Edit
npm install
npm start

env
BOOQABLE_API_KEY=your_api_key_here
BOOQABLE_API_URL=https://{your_company_slug_here}.booqable.com/api

💡 Roadmap
Throw all of these goodies in one web app, with the majority of tools built into shortcodes for wordpress, so eventually that plugin will be the home of majority of this. Minus RentalReminder, that is it's own site and service.
